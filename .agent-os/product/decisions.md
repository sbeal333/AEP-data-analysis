## 2025-01-03: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Building AEP Performance Analytics as a Python-based data analysis platform focused on agent performance analysis. The system will clean and process performance data, identify top performers, and discover success patterns through statistical analysis (without machine learning). Analysis will be performed through Python scripts rather than Jupyter notebooks.

### Context

AEP needs a systematic way to analyze agent performance data and identify what makes certain agents more successful than others. Current data exists in CSV files but lacks proper cleaning and enrichment. Management needs data-driven insights for hiring and training decisions.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Jupyter Notebook-based Analysis**
   - Pros: Interactive development, inline visualizations, easy experimentation
   - Cons: User prefers script-based approach, less suitable for automation

2. **Machine Learning Approach**
   - Pros: Could identify complex patterns, predictive capabilities
   - Cons: User explicitly doesn't want ML, simpler statistical methods sufficient

3. **Generic BI Tool Integration**
   - Pros: Off-the-shelf solution, established tooling
   - Cons: Less customized for specific needs, may be overkill

### Rationale

Chose Python scripts with statistical analysis because:
- User explicitly prefers no Jupyter notebooks
- No machine learning needed - statistical analysis is sufficient
- Script-based approach better for automation and repeatability
- Focused on practical insights rather than complex modeling

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- Easier to automate and schedule
- Clear, reproducible analysis pipeline
- Lower learning curve for team

**Negative:**
- Less interactive development experience
- May need to rebuild some visualization capabilities
- Limited to statistical rather than predictive insights

## 2025-01-03: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use Python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and plotly for data analysis and visualization. No Jupyter notebooks, no machine learning libraries.

### Context

Need robust data manipulation and visualization capabilities while keeping the stack simple and focused on statistical analysis.

### Rationale

This stack provides all necessary tools for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization without unnecessary complexity. Scripts can be easily version-controlled and automated.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Lightweight, focused toolset
- Well-documented libraries with strong community support
- Easy to deploy and maintain

**Negative:**
- May need additional libraries as requirements evolve
- Less interactive than notebook-based development

## 2025-01-03: InnoSource AI Feedback Loop Partnership

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** AEP Management, InnoSource AI Team, Development Team

### Decision

Pivot the project focus from internal AEP analytics to creating a three-way comparison system that feeds performance data back to InnoSource's AI tool for improving candidate selection. The system will compare InnoSource AI ratings, AEP candidate ratings, and actual performance outcomes to create a "trifecta" of data for training AI models.

### Context

Meeting revealed that the primary purpose is to improve InnoSource's AI candidate selection by providing performance feedback data. AEP wants to identify which resume characteristics correlate with successful hires and feed this back to improve the AI's predictive accuracy. The goal is to create a feedback loop comparing three data points: InnoSource AI ratings, AEP's internal rating system (Superior, etc.), and actual performance data.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue with Internal Analytics Only**
   - Pros: Simpler scope, focused on AEP needs
   - Cons: Misses the opportunity to improve candidate selection pipeline

2. **Separate AI Training Project**
   - Pros: Could be developed independently
   - Cons: Would require duplicate data processing and integration work

### Rationale

The AI feedback loop approach provides value to both AEP and InnoSource:
- AEP gets better candidates through improved AI selection
- InnoSource gets performance validation data to train their models
- Creates sustainable partnership with measurable outcomes
- Leverages existing performance data for maximum impact

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Creates value for both parties in the partnership
- Enables continuous improvement of candidate selection
- Provides objective validation of rating systems
- Opens potential for expanded AI collaboration

**Negative:**
- More complex data integration requirements
- Need coordination with InnoSource on data formats
- Success depends on quality of candidate rating data
- Longer timeline for full implementation
