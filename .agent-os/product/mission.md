## Pitch

AEP Performance Analytics is a candidate selection feedback system that creates a three-way comparison between InnoSource AI ratings, AEP candidate ratings, and actual performance data to train InnoSource's AI module to better predict candidate success and improve hiring outcomes.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **InnoSource AI Team**: Need performance data to train and improve their candidate selection AI
- **AEP Management Team**: Executives and managers who need data-driven insights for strategic decisions
- **HR/Talent Analysts**: Teams responsible for hiring, training, and performance management

### User Personas

**InnoSource Data Scientist** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** AI/ML Engineer
- **Context:** Develops and trains AI models for candidate selection
- **Pain Points:** Lack of performance feedback data to validate predictions, no visibility into actual hire outcomes
- **Goals:** Improve AI accuracy, identify resume characteristics that predict success

**AEP Operations Manager** (35-50 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Management
- **Context:** Oversees agent teams and needs to optimize performance
- **Pain Points:** Difficult to identify what makes top performers successful, lack of data-driven hiring insights
- **Goals:** Improve team performance, make better hiring decisions

**HR Analyst** (28-40 years old)
- **Role:** Talent Analytics Specialist
- **Context:** Responsible for recruitment and performance tracking
- **Pain Points:** Manual data processing, disconnected rating systems
- **Goals:** Validate hiring decisions, improve candidate selection process

## The Problem

### No Feedback Loop for AI Hiring Models

InnoSource's AI rates candidates but has no visibility into actual performance outcomes, making it impossible to validate predictions or improve accuracy.

**Our Solution:** Create a three-way comparison system linking InnoSource AI ratings, AEP's candidate ratings, and actual performance data.

### Fragmented Performance Data

Performance data exists in CSV files but lacks proper cleaning, standardization, and formatting for AI consumption.

**Our Solution:** Automated data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline that produces AI-ready datasets.

### Missing Resume-to-Performance Correlation

No systematic way to identify which resume characteristics correlate with successful agent performance.

**Our Solution:** Statistical analysis linking resume data, rating systems, and performance outcomes to identify predictive patterns.

### Disconnected Rating Systems

Three separate rating systems (InnoSource AI, AEP ratings, actual performance) operate independently without comparison or validation.

**Our Solution:** Unified feedback framework that compares all three data points to train and improve AI predictions.

## Differentiators

### Focused Analytics Approach

Unlike generic business intelligence tools, we provide specialized analysis tailored specifically for agent performance metrics. This results in more relevant insights and actionable recommendations.

### Clean Data Pipeline

We emphasize data quality through robust cleaning and validation processes. This ensures reliable analysis outcomes and trustworthy insights for decision-making.
