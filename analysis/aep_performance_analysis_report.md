# AEP Performance Analysis Report

> Analysis of Agent Performance Data for InnoSource AI Feedback Loop
> Report Date: September 3, 2025
> Status: In Progress

## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of AEP agent performance data, designed to create a feedback loop for improving InnoSource's AI-based candidate selection system. Through statistical analysis of 1,002 agents' performance metrics, we have identified top performers and established objective criteria for success that will inform AI model training.

### Key Findings
- Analyzed performance data for 1,002 agents across 164 days (April 4 - September 14, 2024)
- Identified 947 qualified agents (worked ≥10 days) for detailed analysis
- Established performance goals: Talk time ≤279s, Hold ≤10s, ACW ≤41s, AHT ≤330s
- Top 5 performers identified through composite scoring methodology
- Data pipeline successfully cleaned and enriched 150,936 daily performance records

## 1. Data Foundation

### 1.1 Source Data Overview
- **Original Dataset**: AEP-08-04-2024-to-09-14-2024-cleaned.csv
- **Records Processed**: 150,936 daily agent performance records
- **Date Range**: April 4, 2024 - September 14, 2024 (164 unique dates)
- **Agents Analyzed**: 1,002 unique agents
- **Qualified Agents**: 947 (worked ≥10 days)

### 1.2 Data Cleaning Pipeline

The data underwent extensive cleaning and transformation:

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **Date Format Standardization**: Mixed formats (M/D/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY) standardized to YYYY-MM-DD
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate entries for same agent/date combinations
3. **Data Type Corrections**: 
   - Converted percentage strings to decimals
   - Fixed time duration formats (MM:SS to seconds)
   - Standardized numeric fields with comma separators
4. **Missing Value Handling**: Applied business logic for zero/null values
5. **Column Name Normalization**: Snake_case naming convention applied

#### Data Quality Metrics:
- **Completeness**: 100% of critical fields populated post-cleaning
- **Consistency**: All date formats standardized
- **Validity**: All numeric ranges validated against business rules
- **Uniqueness**: Agent-date combinations verified as unique

## 2. Performance Metrics Framework

### 2.1 Established Performance Goals

Based on business requirements, the following performance targets were established:

| Metric | Target | Business Justification |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| Talk Time | ≤ 279 seconds | Optimal customer interaction duration |
| Hold Time | ≤ 10 seconds | Minimize customer wait during calls |
| ACW Time | ≤ 41 seconds | Efficient post-call work |
| AHT | ≤ 330 seconds | Overall efficiency target |

### 2.2 Calculated Metrics

The semantic transformation pipeline added 15 enriched metrics:
- **Goal Achievement Rates**: Daily and all-time goal met percentages
- **Efficiency Scores**: Composite metrics for overall performance
- **Consistency Measures**: Standard deviation of key metrics
- **Productivity Indicators**: Calls per hour, utilization rates

## 3. Top Performer Analysis

### 3.1 Composite Scoring Methodology

A weighted scoring system was developed to identify top performers:

```
Composite Score = (0.40 × Goal Achievement) + 
                  (0.30 × Performance) + 
                  (0.20 × Efficiency) + 
                  (0.10 × Consistency)
```

#### Component Definitions:
- **Goal Achievement (40%)**: Percentage of days meeting all 4 performance goals
- **Performance (30%)**: Normalized productivity metrics (calls handled, occupancy)
- **Efficiency (20%)**: Inverse of average handle time metrics
- **Consistency (10%)**: Inverse of performance variance (lower variance = higher score)

### 3.2 Top 5 Performers Identified

| Rank | Agent Name | Composite Score | Goal Achievement | Days Worked | Key Strengths |
|------|------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Crystal McClure | 1.8015 | 64.2% | 146 | Exceptional efficiency, low AHT |
| 2 | Ashley Clowser | 0.9496 | 99.3% | 70 | Near-perfect goal achievement |
| 3 | Michael Marks | 0.9362 | 97.0% | 123 | Consistent high performance |
| 4 | Jerrico Pickett | 0.9035 | 96.4% | 153 | Sustained excellence over time |
| 5 | Charlene Vaughn | 0.8858 | 95.7% | 141 | Reliable goal attainment |

### 3.3 Performance Distribution

- **Top 10%**: Composite scores > 0.70
- **Top 25%**: Composite scores > 0.55
- **Median**: Composite score = 0.42
- **Bottom 25%**: Composite scores < 0.30

## 4. Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Performance Correlations

Key correlations discovered:
- Strong negative correlation between experience (days worked) and AHT (-0.42)
- Positive correlation between goal achievement rate and consistency (0.38)
- Talk time most predictive of overall goal achievement (r² = 0.65)

### 4.2 Success Patterns

Agents who consistently meet goals share common characteristics:
1. **Lower variance** in daily performance metrics (σ < 20% of mean)
2. **Steady improvement** trajectory in first 30 days
3. **Balanced metrics** - no single metric dominates at expense of others

## 5. InnoSource AI Feedback Integration (Pending)

### 5.1 Data Requirements for AI Training

To complete the feedback loop, we need:
- [ ] InnoSource AI rating scores for all analyzed agents
- [ ] AEP's internal candidate ratings (Superior, Satisfactory, etc.)
- [ ] Resume/profile data with structured characteristics
- [ ] Hiring cohort information for temporal analysis

### 5.2 Planned Three-Way Comparison

Once additional data is received:
1. **Correlation Analysis**: AI predictions vs actual performance
2. **Rating Accuracy**: Compare AI, AEP, and actual performance rankings
3. **Feature Importance**: Identify resume characteristics of top performers
4. **Model Feedback**: Generate training data for AI improvement

## 6. Next Steps

### 6.1 Immediate Actions
1. **Obtain InnoSource AI ratings** for analyzed agents
2. **Collect AEP internal ratings** data
3. **Parse resume data** for top and bottom performers
4. **Establish data exchange format** with InnoSource

### 6.2 Future Enhancements
1. **Cohort Analysis**: Compare performance by hire date/training class
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Build success prediction models
3. **Real-time Dashboard**: Develop monitoring capabilities
4. **Automated Feedback Loop**: Schedule regular data exports to InnoSource

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 For AEP Management
1. **Focus on Consistency**: Top performers show less variance - consider coaching for consistency
2. **Early Intervention**: Performance patterns visible within first 30 days
3. **Balanced Scorecards**: Agents meeting all goals outperform those excelling in single metrics

### 7.2 For InnoSource AI
1. **Weight Recent Performance**: More recent performance data may be more predictive
2. **Consider Consistency Metrics**: Variance in performance is a key differentiator
3. **Track Improvement Trajectory**: Rate of improvement matters as much as absolute performance
